# php-secure-text-encoder
A lightweight PHP class for encrypting and decrypting text using a predefined character mapping. Each character is replaced with a randomly selected encrypted value, enhancing obfuscation. The class supports both encryption and decryption, ensuring accurate text restoration. Suitable for basic text encoding but not for high-security applications.
